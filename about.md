I have been an IT Pro for 12 years, and a coder and sysadmin for over 20 years. My parents bought an i386, running Windows 95, in the late nineties. It came with a collection of hundreds of simple games. The concept of creating digital worlds and objects that could “think” and move captivated me. I begged my parents for a book on programming, and I wrote my first “hello world” program in Java at age 12. When we upgraded our PC a few years later, I built a Linux-based webserver on the old one. I learned to code on that old fossil in C, C++, JavaScript, Perl and PHP. I began my IT Pro career in 2006 while studying Computer Science. In that role, I used my passion for coding and efficiency to enable a team of two sysadmins to maintain a global IT environment of over 400 servers and 5,000 PCs.

Currently I work as a senior sysadmin and IT manager for a medical manufacturing company. My team provides a secure, reliable server and client platform based on a VMware and Microsoft stack. 
I live in New Hampshire with my two adorable children and beautiful wife. I love to hike, Crossfit, play guitar, and read. My current interests include PowerShell, Python, infrastructure automation, robotics, gardening, and keeping my chickens alive.

### About The Curious Sysadmin

The Curious Sysadmin deconstructs excellence into practical tools, techniques and principles. It also serves as a journal of my projects and eclectic interests.
