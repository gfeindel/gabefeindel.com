## Who I am

I live and work in New Hampshire, the best state in the union. I am a follower of Jesus Christ, the husband to a wonderful woman, the father of two cute and crazy kids, and a hopeless geek. 

## What I love

I love to learn, code, hike, workout, and drink (good) coffee. I love to solve sticky problems with elegant solutions. I love to tear things apart to discover how they work. Unfortunately, I'm not as good at putting things back together.

Automation, cloud technology, information security (especially pentesting and forensics), latte-making, guitar, and gardening are some of my current interests.

## What I do 

At work, I lead a team of IT engineers that designs, builds and operates the server and PC infrastructure for a medical manufacturing company. 

At home, I am often trying to build simple furniture, working on home improvements, or protecting my chickens from frigid temperatures and hungry predators. So far, Nature and I are tied, 4 to 4.
