I provide consulting services to small and medium businesses on automation and information security. If you are interested, contact me!

### Automation

If your IT department is like most, you spend most of your time reacting to problems. You want to experiment and innovate, but you just can't find the time. Automation helps you to escape this vicious cycle. I can help you design the processes, build the tools, and train your staff.

### Information Security

Information Security is just as critical for small businesses as for large. Because it deals largely with risk in uncertainty, it is difficult to quantify the ROI of security tools and practices. I can help you design and implement a robust security program based on pragmatic frameworks like [the CIS Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) that balance cost and risk.

### Project-based services

I am happy to talk with you about your specific project needs. If I do not have the right skills to help you, I will help you find the right people!
