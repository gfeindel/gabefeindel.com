This is my first post in Jekyll. Check out how easy this is to use! I type a few lines of text with YAML frontmatter, and poof! A post.

If I want to show a code snippet, I can do that:
{% highlight powershell %}
function Get-Host() {
	Write-HOst "Testing"
}
{% endhighlight %}

If I want to link to something, it's easy. For example, if you want to go to [Google](https://www.google.com/), that's all it takes.
