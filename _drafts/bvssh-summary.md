title: Book Summary: Better Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier

Focus on outcomes (better value, sooner, safer happier.). Agile methods are in service to better outcomes. If you focus on Agile principles instead of outcomes, you risk a "cargo cult" of people who do Agile practices but are not agile at all.

Take an agile approach to business agility. Agile Transformations fail because they attempt to coerce massive change. This fails for many reasons. People have limited cognitive capacity for change. Organization complexity itself is an obstacle. Forced change creates fear and reduces autonomy.

People are motivated by autonomy, purpose and mastery. They are inspired by contributions to social, organizational, customer, peer and self improvement.

Start with Why and phrase in these terms. Repeat as often as you can, and it still won't be nearly enough.

Start small, but grass-roots only approaches create pockets of agile, which fail. Middle management "the pressureized middle" must be supportive, but they are often the most resistant.

Change takes as long as it takes. If you rush it will fail. Recruit your innovators first. Create "ways of working centers of enablement." These are communities of practice that help the innovators. As more people get on board, the laggards come around or leave the org.

People experience the "five stages of grief" in response to change. The "bigger" the transformation, the deeper and longer the trough of disillusion/depression.
