## Skills

### Soft Skills
  
  - Culturally aware. I have much room to grow, but my experience working with global teams has taught me a great deal about the differences in cultures and how they affect communication, disagreement, decision-making, and more.
  - Writing. As Jeff Bezos says, writing is an essential skill for any leader. I'd like to think my writing is well above average, and I leverage that skill to inspire, persuade and educate others. 
  - Team player. I love to helps others grow through mentoring and coaching. I foster teamwork and promote open, honest dialog. 
  - Client-focused. The IT profession is fundamentally a service provider. I am committed to understanding the client's needs and finding the right solution.
  - Leadership. The best way to lead is by example. I have experience leading small teams both at work and church, which involves casting vision, shaping culture, and driving results.
  - Rapid learner. I am an insatiable student, always seeking to learn new things  and improve myself. I'm a big fan of Tim Ferriss and find his DiSSS model very useful for effective skill acquisition.
