I thrive on using technology to help others succeed. My love for people, passion for learning, and experience in IT and software development uniquely equip me to create technology solutions that help others realize their potential. 

## Skills

### Soft Skills
  
  - Cultural awareness. Most of my career has been with global teams. This experience has taught me much about how cultural differences shape communication, disagreement, decision-making, and more.
  - Writing. George Orwell said, "if people cannot write well, they cannot think well." Clear writing requires clear thinking. I'd like to think my writing is well above average. I write to inspire, persuade and educate others. I created this website, in part, to sharpen my writing skills. 
  - Team player. Effective teams undergird all successful companies. I love to mentor and coach others. In fact, I think coaching is my primary leadership style. I foster teamwork and promote trust, accountability, client-focus, and results orientation.
  - Client-focused. The IT Pro is a consultant, not a waiter. I always seek to understand the client's need, the problem to solve, before suggesting a solution. 
  - Leadership. I have never been an executive or business leader, but I have led small teams both at work and church, positions which involved casting vision, shaping culture, and driving results. The topic of leadership fascinates me, and I enjoy reading about it and learning from other experienced leaders. 
  - Rapid learner. I am an insatiable student, always seeking to learn new things, improve myself, and share my learnings with others.
